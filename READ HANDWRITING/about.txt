== Introduction ==

Neural networks and deep learning are two success stories in modern artificial intelligence. 
They’ve led to major advances in image recognition, automatic text generation, and even in self-driving cars.

To get involved with this exciting field, you should start with a manageable dataset.

The MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Challenge is the classic entry point. Image data is 
generally harder to work with than “flat” relational data. The MNIST data is beginner-friendly 
and is small enough to fit on one computer.

Handwriting recognition will challenge you, but it doesn’t need high computational power.

To start, we recommend with the first chapter in the tutorial below. It will teach you how 
to build a neural network from scratch that solves the MNIST challenge with high accuracy.

== Tutorial ==

Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Online Book) – Chapter 1 walks through how to write a neural
network from scratch in Python to classify digits from MNIST. The author also gives a very good
explanation of the intuition behind neural networks.

== Data Sources ==

MNIST – MNIST is a modified subset of two datasets collected by the U.S. National Institute of
Standards and Technology. It contains 70,000 labeled images of handwritten digits.
